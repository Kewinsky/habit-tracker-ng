# ðŸ§  HabitTrackerNg

A habit-tracking application built with **Angular**, **Firebase Firestore**, and **Angular Material**. Users can create, update, track, and complete habits with a focus on consistency and long-term progress.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Create, view, edit, and delete habits (CRUD)
- Track **current** and **longest** streaks
- Mark habits as complete for today
- Dashboard with habit statistics
- Responsive UI using **Angular Material**
- Data persistence using **Firebase Firestore**
- Built with **Standalone Angular Components** (Angular 17+)

## ðŸ›  Development Setup

To run the app locally:

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

Then visit [`http://localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200)

## ðŸ§ª Mock Data Seeding

You can seed example habits (with pre-filled streaks, completed dates, etc.) by calling this method in `HabitService`:

```ts
this.habitService.seedHabits();
```

This is helpful for local testing and UI development. Remove the call afterward to prevent duplication.
